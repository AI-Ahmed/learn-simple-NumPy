# learn-simple-NumPy
_"NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more."

This repository created to help the developers who want to engage in #Data-science or #Data-analysis to learn and know about **NumPy** without feeling conflicted or complexed.

A simple repository that helps you to understand the general tools of NumPy that you will need to enter the world of data science and data analysis. 

This repository is about [#jupyter-notebook](https://jupyter.org/) files: each one of them includes a topic about numpy and what does each tool do.
